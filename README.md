# Advanced-Housing-Prediction
Objective:- The main aim of this project is to predict the house price based on various features.


- In Data Analysis(EDA) I have Analyzed To Find out the below stuff
1. Missing Values
2. All The Numerical Variables
3. Distribution of the Numerical Variables
4. Categorical Variables
5. Cardinality of Categorical Variables
6. Outliers
7. Relationship between independent and dependent feature(SalePrice)

- FEATURE ENGINEERING
I have performed all the below steps in Feature Engineering

1. Missing values
2. Temporal variables
3. Categorical variables: remove rare labels
4. Standarise the values of the variables to the same range
